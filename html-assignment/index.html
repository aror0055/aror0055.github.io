                    About Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Parth Arora, and I am currently in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IMD
                    </abbr> at Algonquin College. I am 20 years old, and I am an international student. I am from India
                    and it is my 2<sup>nd</sup> year with Algonquin College. I switched my programs from <abbr
                        title="Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science">CET-CS</abbr> to <abbr
                        title="Interactive Media Design"> IMD </abbr> because I concluded that the program was not for
                    me and I decided to switch to a more creative field. I studied <em>science</em> in high school, but
                    I was never really into it, but I have been a photography enthusiast since my 15<sup>th</sup>
                    birthday when my parents gifted me a camera.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love photography and it has been an integral part of my life. This program interests me as I want
                    to explore the <em>creative side</em> of my nature and make it into a career. I believe my next step
                    will be to work in a company in the creative field of designing and content creation. I am also open
                    to further education, but I would like to gain some industry experience before pursuing that route.
                    I would love to work in some of the biggest names in the market one day.
                </p>
